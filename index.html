          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p class="my-description">As a student, I've discovered the thrill of coding, a skill that allows me to turn my ideas into reality. What truly excites me is applying my programming skills to tackle and solve real-world challenges.</p>

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p class="code-skill">I first got into coding when I was 17, starting with Python because I wanted to make my own video games. As I got deeper into coding, I started learning other languages too, to broaden my skills and understanding. Now, after years of learning and improving, I've come back to Python again, but now I know so much more from learning other languages. Right now, I'm working hard to get better at Python and C#, so I can start making video games like I've always wanted to.</p>

            <h3>Front End & Back End Developement</h3>
            <p class="code-skill">Following my initiation into Python, I ventured into the realm of web design, beginning with WordPress. However, it wasn't long before I questioned, 'Why not learn to build a website from scratch?' gaining foundational knowledge in HTML/CSS/JS and Java. This new learning path allowed me to take web design into my own hands.</p>
